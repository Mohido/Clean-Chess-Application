# Explanations:  
1) .cimg files: An easy readable text file (generated via a simple java program from any type of image) that contains: ImageWidth, ImageHeight , then array of rgb colours in this specific order..... each colour value is 1 byte. You can download the .cimg generator from the github of "Mohido" Contributer.
2) Sounds are loaded from .wav files that are in the UTIL/sound

# Future features:  
1) Implement stalemate. (Draw) for now it shows that the other player won instead of drawing.
2) En passant move needs to be implemented
